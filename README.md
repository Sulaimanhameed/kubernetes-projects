## 📑 Phase 1: Kubernetes Setup & Fundamentals

In Phase 1, we will deploy different types of applications by creating each object manually. If you are learning Kubernetes, this will help you relate each object to real-world setups. It will also help you understand complex Helm charts and create custom application manifests from scratch.
